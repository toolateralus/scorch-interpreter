- all numbers are currently f64/doubles. type name 'float'

- newlines are expression terminators, like semi colon in C.

- := is implicit assignment
- varname : type = value is explicit assignment

- if else use parentheses-less comparisons.
```

// else does not currently require an if to do a comparison.
// this is not a planned feature.
if true {
   ... 
} else false {
   ...
}
```

- func_name := {} is a paramless fn
- func_name := (a: String, b: String) {}  is a parameterized fn
